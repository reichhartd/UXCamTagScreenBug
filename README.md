# UXCamTagScreenBug

## Getting started

1. Replace `'YOUR API KEY'` in `./src/UXCamProvider.ts` with a valid one
2. Start the App on Android and click on different screens
3. Start the App on iOS and click on different screens
4. See in UXCam on the "Screen Flow" tab, that on Android the correct screen names are tagged, but on iOS the names of the native views
